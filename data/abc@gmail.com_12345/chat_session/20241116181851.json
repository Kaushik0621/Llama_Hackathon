Since you mentioned earlier that you need some help, I'd like to ask again: what's been going on that's causing you concern? Is it a specific symptom, a health issue, or something else entirely?\n\nIf you're not feeling comfortable sharing details, that's okay too! We can start with some general questions to get a better sense of what's going on. For example, how have you been feeling lately? Have you noticed any changes in your body or energy levels?\n\nRemember, everything we discuss is confidential and non-judgmental. I'm here to listen and help in any way I can."}
